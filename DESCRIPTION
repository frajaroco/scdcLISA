Description: Basic toolkit for cluster detection in spatial point patterns
    through the local versions of the second-order product density function
    set a powerful tool to address the problem of classification of interesting
    subpatterns. The LISA functions can then be grouped into bundles of similar
    functions using multivariate hierarchical clustering techniques according to a
    particular statistical distances.
